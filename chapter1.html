            We begin by learning a little about the properties of light. We 
            will use 
            visual models like the one shown to the right to represent 
            a laser beam.

            Light carries energy and this
        energy comes in discrete packets called photons.  The number carried
        in even a fairly weak beam, as in a small laser pointer, is truly stupendous.
        Put your hand in a weak laser beam and a every second about 
        1,000,000,000,000 (a thousand trillion) 
        photons will be hitting it.

            In a real laser, the photons move at the speed of light.
            We've slowed them down by a factor of about a trillion here.  With
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode">
            right kind of detector</a>, and a weak enough beam, you can actually
            hear a click every time a photon is absorbed.

            When you are ready to continue hit the forward arrow.
