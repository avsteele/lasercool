            This chapter explores the composition of light. 
            Usually we will be talking about the properties of light emitted 
            by lasers. Through the chapters we will use a 
            visual models like the one shown to the right to represent 
            a laser beam.

            Light carries energy and this
        energy comes in discrete packets called photons.  The number carried
        in even a fairly weak beam, as in a small laser pointer, is truly stupendous.
        Put your hand in a weak laser beam and a every second about 1,000,000,000,000 (a thousand trillion) 
        photons will be htiting it.
