            We begin by learning a little about the properties of light. We 
            will use 
            visual models like the one shown to the right to represent 
            a laser beam.

            Light carries <em>energy</em> and this
        energy comes in discrete packets called photons.  The number carried
        in even a fairly weak beam, as in a small laser pointer, is truly stupendous.
        Put your hand in a weak laser beam with about a milliwatt of power 
        and a every second about 
        1,000,000,000,000 (a thousand trillion) 
        photons will be hitting it.

            In a real laser, the photons move at the speed of light.
            We've slowed them down by a factor of about a trillion here.  With
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode">
            right kind of detector</a>, and a weak enough beam, you can actually
            hear a click every time a photon is absorbed.

            Photons also carry <em>momentum</em>.  If absorbed, they exert a 
        little kick and can push objects around.  Each photons only provides the
        tiniest of kicks, but added together, and over time a beam of light can
        get everyday objects to move.  This force is often called <em>radiation
        pressure</em>.

            One of the more exciting proposals for sending a ship to 
            a nearby star system would use radiation pressure to push tiny satelites
            up to enormous speeds.  The satelites would deploy a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail">solar 
            sail</a> to catch the light.
